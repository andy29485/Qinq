## How To Use

### Playing
1. Start game(run the .jar file)
2. Each player must connect to address specified on the screen using a
   (modern) web browser
  - **be sure to include the port** (the colon and the numbers after it)
3. Players must chose a name and click the `create player` button
5. (**Optional**) Select questions for this game
  1. Click options on the main window of the program(**not** in a browser)
  2. Select the check boxes for the categories witch you wish to include
  3. Add custom questions in the `Custom Questions` text area 
    - One question per line
  4. Click Back
6. Click Start
7. Players should follow the instructions(intuitive) on the web page.
  - Answer questions and click submit
  - Vote: click the answers they like
  - Etc...

### Create Custom Question Categories
1. In the directory with the jar, create another directory named `questions`
2. For each category you wish to add, create a text file
   named `<category-name>.txt`
3. Add on question per line to the category file you believe the question
   belongs in
   - The same question can exist in multiple categories

### Start internet session(slower)
Sometimes you want to play with people that are not on your local network
(aka another house). For this to work there needs to be a web-server that
connects non-local clients with your computer. See `web/` dir for more info.
1. Go to options.
2. Find the `Remote Server Connector`.
3. (opt) Change the URL to point to your desired server.
4. Click Start
5. Click Back
  - A new URL should have appeared in the gray box.
6. Have clients direct their Web Browsers to that URL.
